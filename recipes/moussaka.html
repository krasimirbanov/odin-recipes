      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p><strong>Moussaka</strong> is an eggplant- or potato-based dish, often
        including ground meat, which is common in the Balkans and the Middle East, with many local and regional
        variations.
      </p>
      <p>Most versions are based primarily on sautéed aubergine (eggplant) and tomato, usually with minced meat, mostly
        lamb. The
        Greek version includes layers of meat and eggplant topped with a béchamel ("white") sauce and baked.</p>

   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p><strong>Tzatziki</strong>(Greek: τζατζίκι), also known as tarator ,is a dip, soup, or sauce
    found in the cuisines of Southeast Europe and the Middle East. It is made of salted strained yogurt or diluted
    yogurt mixed with cucumbers, garlic, salt, olive oil, sometimes with vinegar or lemon juice, and herbs such as dill,
    mint, parsley and thyme. It is served as a cold appetizer (mezze), a side dish, and as a sauce for souvlaki and
    gyros sandwiches and other foods.
   </p>
   <p><strong>Tarator</strong> was the name of a dish made of ground walnuts and vinegar in the Ottoman Empire. Dishes
    of various
    preparations in the region, including dips, salads, and sauces, acquired the name. In the Levant, taratur is a sauce
    based on tahini, while in Turkey and the Balkans it came to mean a combination of yogurt and cucumbers, sometimes
    with walnuts. It has become a traditional part of meze.[7]
